# Customer_Subscription_Analysis
The goal of this project is to build an accurate predictive model to help financial institutions enhance their marketing strategies and customer targeting.
The project aims to develop machine learning models to predict whether a customer will subscribe (y = yes) or not (y = no) to a term deposit based on customer characteristics and marketing campaign data. Various machine learning techniques are applied, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
The process involves data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling), exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, and model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. Hyperparameter tuning is conducted using Grid Search and Random Search to optimize model performance, and SHAP values are used for feature importance analysis.
